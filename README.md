### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure Firebase

Create `src/firebase.js` with your project config:

```js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app'
import { getDatabase } from 'firebase/database'

const app = initializeApp({
  apiKey: '...',
  authDomain: '...',
  databaseURL: '...',
  projectId: '...',
  storageBucket: '...',
  messagingSenderId: '...',
  appId: '...',
})

export const db = getDatabase(app)
```

npm run build     # production build
npm run preview   # preview production build
```

## Game Modes

### Online
1. One player creates a room → shares the 6-character code
2. Friend joins with the code
3. Creator picks who guesses
4. Setter enters a movie name (password-masked input)
5. Guesser clicks letters on the QWERTY keyboard (or types them)
6. 6 lives, 2.5-minute timer per guess
7. **Play Again** keeps the room alive and returns both players to role selection instantly

### vs Bot — You Guess
- Select a language → bot picks a random movie from that language's pool
- You guess letters; bot never makes mistakes picking the word

### vs Bot — Bot Guesses
- You enter any movie name → bot guesses a random letter every 1.4 seconds
- Watch the bot's progress; each guess shows ✅ Correct / ❌ Wrong
